<p> <div class="description"> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major brain disease, afflicting about 18 million elderly people worldwide. This figure will rise with increasing longevity, so there is an urgent need for effective treatment. The brains of AD sufferers contain many abnormal deposits called plaques and tangles, which are thought to play a crucial role in the disease. However, the causes of their formation and of the disease itself are unknown. We have been investigating whether a common virus has a role in AD. We found that many elderly people harbour this virus within their brain but only those who have a specific genetic factor are at risk of developing AD. Subsequently we discovered that the viral DNA is located specifically within plaques; also, infection with this virus causes production of the main components of plaques and tangles (called beta-amyloid and abnormal tau), indicating that the virus might be a cause of these abnormal deposits. Our recent experiments with antiviral agents indicate that they might be an effective treatment to slow AD progression in that they decrease the levels of beta-amyloid and abnormal tau which the virus induces. Also, the future possibility exists of prevention of the disease by vaccination against the virus.

<p> <div class="description"> We are interested in how animals detect light and how they respond to it. We study light sensitive proteins from animals and how they might be used to improve human health. We are particularly interested in how these proteins might be used to restore vision to people who are blind because of damage to their retina. Another area of interest is in how we measure the big differences in light intensity over the 24hr day and use it to tell time. The amount of light reaching the earth's surface various enormously from starlight night to midday sun. Measuring this change in light intensity is the most reliable way for animals (including humans for most of our evolution) to tell time of day. It is perhaps unsurprising then that animals have evolved specialised mechanisms for measuring light intensity. We study these light measurement systems to find out how they work, how they help us see and what effects they have on our behaviour and how our bodies function.

<p> <div class="description"> Studies of invertebrate animals have long been used to increase our knowledge of how our own nervous system works. The reason such studies are useful is that the way nerve cells work is similar right across the animal kingdom, from invertebrates to humans. Invertebrates have many advantages for scientific study: they are cheap and easy to keep in the lab; their life cycle is usually short, enabling rapid genetic crossing work and studies of different developmental stages; and their simplicity - in terms of the total numbers of cells involved - makes their nervous systems much easier to study. One of the least understood of our senses is the sense of smell. In one study, we are using the simple ‘nose’ of the fruit fly larva (maggot) to study how a small number of sense cells can identify a large number of different odours. The larva’s nose has only 21 sense cells and we have studied each of these to find out which odours it can detect. We are currently investigating how the 21 nerve cells together ‘code’ for different odours. This includes building a computer model which mimics the coding of information that occurs in the nose.
